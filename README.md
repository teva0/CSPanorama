# CS Panorama Source Code Datamine
This is a datamine of the source code within `csgo/panorama/code.pbin` for every version of CS:GO since they released the panorama UI update. 

I am working on datamining the CS2 updates now. 

Interestingly, the assets are moved from `csgo/panorama/code.pbin` to `game/csgo/pak01_dir.vpk` for CS2

All changes are dated in the commit title, Ill rerun the bot which generates this every few months to add all the new updates.
